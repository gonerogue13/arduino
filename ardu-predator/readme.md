Predator shoulder cannon robotics code 
Uses two GY-521 MPU6050 Breakout Boards - One fixed to the body, the other dynamic on the head.
By calculating the difference between tilt and yaw angles we can keep the shoulder cannon pointing 
along our relative line of vision, regardless of our absolute body position.
